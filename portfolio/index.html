        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            From Pixels to Protection: A Passionate Tech Journey<br>As a Webmaster and Digital Marketing Officer at Wisconsin International University College, Ghana, 
            I manage the website content, design, and performance, as well as the online marketing campaigns and strategies. I have over four years of experience in 
            web development, graphic design, and digital marketing, working with various clients and organizations, including El Jay Creatives, a company 
            I co-founded in 2016.<br> I hold a BSc in Computer Engineering from Ghana Communication Technology University, where I developed my coding and problem-solving 
            skills. I am also passionate about learning new technologies and skills, and I have completed multiple online courses and boot camps on topics such as IoT, 
            podcasting, and introduction to cybersecurity. My goal is to leverage my design and coding skills to create innovative, impactful, and secure solutions for 
            local and global problems.<br>My ambition burns brightest when facing new challenges. Today, I'm on a path toward cybersecurity. Fuelled by the desire to 
            protect what I create, I'm pursuing a Certified Ethical Hacking certification. This journey combines my passion for technology with the critical need 
            for secure coding and system defense.<br>Looking ahead, I see boundless possibilities in cloud computing. Its potential to optimize and secure data 
            aligns perfectly with my evolving skillset.
